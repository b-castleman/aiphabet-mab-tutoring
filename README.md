# Automatic Curriculum ZPDES Memory
Combines automatic Curriculum Generation[1,2] with a modified version of the ZPDES algorithm[3] that includes a memory module[4].

See Part1_create_curriculum_example.ipynb For an example for creating the curriculum representation used by the progression algorithm and Part2_progression_algorithm_example.ipynb for an example of using the progression algorithm to progress students.
